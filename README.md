# The Effect of Crypto-Asset Price on User Behaviors in Decentralized Lending Protocols


## Introduction


Smart contracts have facilitated the rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols that offer financial services without relying on an intermediary such as a bank or brokerage house. Among these groundbreaking DeFi applications is decentralized lending, empowering users to engage in cryptocurrency lending and borrowing at a floating interest rate, governed by the logic programmed in the smart contracts.

The objective of this study is to construct a statistical model to explain the behavior of users within Compound V2, one of the main DeFi protocols in the Ethereum blockchain. Building upon our previous research, we will analyze the balance sheets and aggregated user activities of the lending pools, regarding the crypto-asset price dynamics. The anticipated model should help understand how users respond to a high-volatility market and the subsequent influence of their behaviors on asset prices.


## Organisation

This repository is organised as follows: 

- All the datasets are contained in the `data` folder. 
- Regarding our models and studies, they will be separated in different Python notebooks contained in the `notebook` folder.
